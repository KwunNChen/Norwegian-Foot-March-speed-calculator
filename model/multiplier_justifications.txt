Ideal pacing assumes uniform, boots, and 11 kg ruck. Early pacing is deliberately conservative to account for boot stiffness, 
ruck settling, and cardiovascular ramp-up. Minor mid-march fatigue is accepted and offset by a controlled final push, 
consistent with military load-carriage doctrine and endurance pacing research.
